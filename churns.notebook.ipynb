    "  In a world where communication means are evolving rapidly it is important for a company such as ours to keep upto date with our customers as they are the true heroes in our journey.That is why when customers stop using our products in a phenomenon known as churn we get concerned as it impacts our market shares,revenue and even affect our brand name.\n",

    "  To solve this problem our company decided to undertake a pro active approach via  a data driven method to solve this problem and find out why our customers have suddenly decided to stop using our products.We feel it is the right step to undertake so that we are able to solve the issues affecting our customers and make a difference\n",

    "\n",
    "**Volatile Market:** The telecom market is saturated, with competitors constantly offering aggressive promotions, making customer loyalty fragile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Dimensionality:** Churn is often influenced by multiple interacting factors, such as service quality, pricing, contract terms, technical support experiences, and specific calling/data habits, making it difficult to isolate the key drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Imbalance:** In a stable business, the number of customers who churn is typically small compared to those who remain loyal. This class imbalance can make training an accurate predictive model difficult."
